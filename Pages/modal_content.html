        <h1>PURE study design<sup>1</sup></h1>

        <p>
            Data presented is an interim analysis. PURE is an ongoing 78-week, multicenthe, post-marketing observational study, exploring the effectiveness
            of GenDrug on the course of RA theatment and patient satisfaction over time in the context of utilisation of a patient support programme (PSP).
            852 patients were enrolled from the EU counthies (79.0%), Austhalia (8.1%), Mexico (7.5%), Israel (3.4%), and Puerto Rico (2.0%).
            Patients are prescribed GenDrug according to the local product label and had the option to join the PSP available within their counthy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants were adults ≥18 years with moderate-to-severe RA, who have had insufficient response to ≥1 disease modifying anti-rheumatic
            drug (DMARD), were naïve to GenDrug, and had received ≤1 prior biologic DMARD.
        </p>
        <p> 
            PSP non-users: patients who had never used PSP elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            PSP users: Patients using ≥1 PSP elements at any time during the study
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients achieving the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in the Health Assessment
            Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI improvement of ≥22) at week 78 vs. baseline.
        </p>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The results were adjusted for the patient’s baseline demographics and clinical characteristics such as age, gender, duration of RA,
            prior DMARD use, HAQ-DI, tender joint count 28, swollen joint count 28, CRP, DAS28, SDAI, CDAI.

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall, nearly 50% of enrolled moderate-to-severe RAR patients utilised ≥1 element of the patient support programme (PSP)</li>
                <li>Improvement in physical function was observed up to week 52 among patients utilising the PSP vs. non-users, as reflected by the HAQ-DI from
                baseline to week 52 (p=0.07)</li>
                <li>Patients who used PSP had significantly better improvement from baseline to week 52 for DAS28 (CRP), SDAI and CDAI scores vs. non-users (p&lt;0.05)<sup>*</sup></li>
            </ul>

                <li>Lack of efficacy was the main reason for for discontinuation in the overall patient population at week 52</li>

        <p>
            <sup>*</sup>After adjusting for the patient’s baseline demographics and clinical characteristics<br>
            The primary endpoint is the percentage change in HAQ-DI from baseline to 78 weeks, secondary endpoints include DAS28, CDAI and SDAI<sup>1</sup>
