This is a project that I recieved to test my abilities with html javaScript and CSS. I built it in 2 weeks period sitting after work. 
This project was supposed to have only few options. Only selected buttons were supposed to show other windows. Rest of the buttons is not linked.
Pages were supposed to look as those in the pdf file provided in "initial test materials folder"
There are 2 pages here. First is the main page "index.html" second page is placed in pages forlder and is called "page2.html"
Those pages are not connected since this was not required. 


Technologies used in project:
-JQuery
-Bootstrap for resizing

Features:
-Popup modal windows
-AJAX content loading from "modal_content.html" file with JQuery commands

Project was unfinished but looks decent. It even got me an interview.
